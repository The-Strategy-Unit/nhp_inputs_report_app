These illustrate the combined distributions of all schemes' responses as either a density plot (PDF) or a cumulative density plot (ECDF) along with their 80% prediction intevals.

Use these to compare the focal scheme's response against an amalgam of all other schemes' responses.

#### Structure

Mitigators are listed in separate plots (facets) with the 80% prediction interval on the x-axes and the y-axis showing the density of the mixture distribution.

Overlaying the plots are dotted lines indicating the 80% prediction interval for the overall distributions, highlighted in turquoise, and a dashed line indicating the mid point.

The focal scheme's 80% prediction interval is shown as a point-range plot.

Plots with a narrow bell-shaped curve indicate alignment in how schemes have responded to this mitigator.

Plots with multiple peaks or very wide prediction intervals indicate variation in schemes' responses.

#### Settings

##### Show ECDF?

Toggle this option to switch between the density plot and the cumulative density plot.

These are useful to simplify complex, multi-peak distributions to a smoother line.

##### Show NEE range?

Enable this option to see the range of values suggested from the National Elicitation Exercise (NEE) as bars.

These are useful aid to check if values are within the ranges suggested by national experts.
