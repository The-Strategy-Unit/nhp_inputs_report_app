Heatmaps visualise values in a 2D grid of cells by scheme and mitigators. The colour of cells indicates the value shown, with darker shades being lower values and lighter tints being higher values.

Use these for an at-a-glance sense of how values vary across scheme and mitigators.

#### Structure

Mitigators are listed on the y-axis and schemes are spread across the x-axis.

Values are shown as cells at intersections between scheme and mitigator and represented by a colour, often with a percentage value too.

Empty spaces indicate where a scheme has not set a value for a mitigator.

#### Settings

##### Value type

Select a value from the drop-down list to be displayed in the heatmap. The default option is 'Midpoint', with options for:

-   'Range' - the difference the low and high values of the selected 80% prediction interval / activity mitigated

-   'Low' - the 10% value

-   'High' - the 90% value

-   'Binary' - indicating where a response has or has not been provided by schemes

##### Standardise by horizon length

The 80% prediction-interval ranges are estimates for reduced activity by a chosen horizon year. The percent of activity mitigated are the inverse - an estimate for how much activity is mitigated against by the chosen horizon year.

Schemes have chosen different horizon years, which may explain some of the variation between schemes.

To compare the change **per year** you can enable this option to better compare schemes.

##### Show mitigator names

Enable this option to switch between mitigator names and the mitigator codes.

Using mitigator codes is useful if horizontal space is limited.
